# DAA: Solutions for my Algorithms Analysis and Design course, 2022.

This repo exists because I wished I had something like it during my AAD course. It should be noted that proof of these solutions are not perfect and should not be used as a template for your own formalized solutions, these are in my opinion in the best quality I could achieve in the time I had to make them. Good luck on your journey!


All three projects are solutions for their respective Codeforces problem. Each folder contains:

- A formalized proof of the solution written in LaTeX.
- A Python script for the solution given the input data.
- A tester script that generates `n` randomized test cases and verifies the solver's solution using a brute force algorithm.
