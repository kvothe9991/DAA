# DAA: Solutions for my Algorithms Analysis and Design course, 2022.

All three projects are solutions for their respective Codeforces problem. Each folder contains:

- A formalized demonstration in LaTeX of the solution.
- A Python script for the solution given the input data.
- A tester script that generates `n` randomized test cases and verifies the solver's solution using a brute force algorithm.
